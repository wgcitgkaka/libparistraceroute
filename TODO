 . why do we need to wait that 10.0.0.1 is complete to send probes to next hop ?



TODO


-check if working in case of timeout response
-create queue for sending
-check error printing (not only on DEBUG, change the DEBUG printing syustem)
-check the actual time for timeout in execution_algorithm (if negative value, ...)
-doc
-add in algo_s struct and functions to manage 2 listes of probe (complete and waiting)
-problem of adding a field that already exist and so freeing the old value
-test when sniffer has no filter
-check ending when packet fields missing
-check the final free
-test with names too short
-manage the send of C-c to end prog (freeing data)
-repair the non freed data problem
-test test test
-add transformation DNS from name adress to ip address
-ajout TCP et IPv6
-fonctions manquantes pour algo.c
-change the network function so it stops by itfself
-treatment of options in IP, tcp, ...

DONE
-add traceroute algo :D
-short nb parameters in create_probe
-change the probe gestion of parameters (fields instead of struct, possibility to create whatever from list of proto
-check the source adress estimation
-add after_filling and after_checksum for protos and call in create_packet
-check field_s malloc'ing
-replace names (struct in first, ...)
-struct accesses
-check prob when checking size of parameters string to find algo or output, etc
